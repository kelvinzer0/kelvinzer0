# Hello, I'm Kelvin Yuli Andrian! üëã

Welcome to my digital space! I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** who thrives on building and collaborating to create meaningful technological solutions. For me, software development is about solving problems and adding value, and I believe that collaboration is key to achieving great things.

I enjoy the diverse journey within the tech world, from designing efficient backend systems and managing infrastructure with a DevOps approach, to crafting intuitive user experiences on the frontend. I also have a keen interest in cybersecurity and exploring low-level systems.

## üöÄ My Product Ideology

- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**  
  Don‚Äôt start by building the full product. *"Sell it first"* through ads or a simple landing page, collect contacts, validate demand, then build the product.

- **GPD (Gather ‚Äì Plan ‚Äì Decide):**  
  Stress and worry don‚Äôt help. Gather information ‚Üí plan ‚Üí make a decision. Execution > overthinking.

- **Core Principle:**  
  Building products is easy, but **validating the market is what creates real value**.
